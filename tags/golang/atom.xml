    <link href="http://kidoman.io/programming/async-io-part-1.html"/>
    <updated>2014-05-13T16:24:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://kidoman.io/programming/async-io-part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently reading a <a href="http://venkateshcm.com/2014/04/Reactor-Pattern-Part-4-Write-Sequential-Non-Blocking-IO-Code-With-Fibers-In-NodeJS/">series</a> on &ldquo;Write Sequential Non-Blocking IO Code With Fibers in NodeJS&rdquo; by <a href="http://venkateshcm.com/">Venkatesh</a>.</p>

<p>Venki was essentially trying to emphasize that writing non-blocking code in NodeJS (either via callbacks, or using promises) can get hairy really fast. For example, this code demonstrates that aptly:</p>

<p>```javascript Callback driven NodeJS
var express = require(&lsquo;express&rsquo;);
var app = express();</p>

<p>app.get(&lsquo;/users/:fbId&rsquo;, function(req, res) {
  var id = req.params.id;
  var key = &lsquo;user:&rsquo; + id;
  client.get(key, function(err, reply) {</p>

<pre><code>if (err !== null) {
  res.send(500);
  return;
}

if (reply === null) {
  res.send(404);
  return;
}

res.send(200, {id: id, name: reply});
</code></pre>

<p>  });
});</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>The exact code is available on <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/fibrous/blob/master/nodejs/callback.js#L59-L72">GitHub</a> (so is the <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/fibrous/blob/master/nodejs/promise.js#L55-L65">promises driven version</a>, but I won&rsquo;t bother inlining it.)</p>

<p>What we actually wanted to write (if it were possible, was):</p>

<p>```javascript Not plain old JavaScript
var express = require(&lsquo;express&rsquo;);
var app = express();</p>

<p>app.get(&lsquo;/users/:fbId&rsquo;, function(req, res) {
  var id = req.params.id;
  var key = &lsquo;user:&rsquo; + id;</p>

<p>  try {</p>

<pre><code>var reply = client.get(key);
if (reply === null) {
  res.send(404);
  return;
}

res.send(200, {id: id, name: reply});
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  catch(err) {</p>

<pre><code>  res.send(500);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
});
```</p>

<p>The magic would happen in line number 9 (above.) Instead of having to provide a cascade of callbacks (what if we wanted to do another lookup after we got the value back from the first), we could just write them serially, one after the other.</p>

<p>Well. Apparently we can!</p>

<h2>Fibers</h2>

<blockquote><p>A fiber is a particularly lightweight thread of execution. Like threads, fibers share address space. However, fibers use co-operative multitasking while threads use pre-emptive multitasking. Threads often depend on the kernel&rsquo;s thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread; fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fibers allow exactly this kind of black magic in NodeJS. It is still callbacks internally, but we are exposed to none of it in our application code. Sure you will end up writing a bunch of wrappers (or have some tool generate them for us), but we would have the sweet sweet pleasure of writing async IO code without having to jump through all the hoops. This is how the wrapper code for redis client looks like:</p>

<p>```javascript
var Fiber = require(&lsquo;fibers&rsquo;);
var client = require(&lsquo;./redis-client&rsquo;);</p>

<p>exports.get = function(key) {
  var err, reply;
  var fiber = Fiber.current;
  client.get(key, function(<em>err, </em>reply) {</p>

<pre><code>err = _err;
reply = _reply;
fiber.run();
</code></pre>

<p>  });
  Fiber.yield();
  if (err != null) {</p>

<pre><code>throw err;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  return reply;
};
```</p>

<p>(the <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/fibrous/blob/master/nodejs/fiber.js#L52-L60">real code</a> is here in case you are curious)</p>

<p>I liked how the code looked. Having survided a &lsquo;promising&rsquo; node.js project, I was definitely curious about this new style. Maybe this can be the saving grace (before generators and <strong>yield</strong> take over the JS world) for real world server side JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Fibers you say</h2>

<p>But the code (and the underlying technique which makes it tick) sounded very familiar, and reminded me of a similar technique which is used in Go to allow writing beautiful async IO code. For example, the same function from above in Go:</p>

<p>```go
m.Get(&ldquo;/users/:id&rdquo;, func(db *DB, params martini.Params) (int, []byte) {
  str := params[&ldquo;id&rdquo;]
  id, err := strconv.Atoi(str)
  if err != nil {</p>

<pre><code>return http.StatusBadRequest, []byte{}
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  u, err := db.LoadUser(id)
  if err != nil {</p>

<pre><code>return http.StatusNotFound, []byte{}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  return http.StatusOK, encoder.Must(enc.Encode(u))
})
```</p>

<p>Sure, there is a little more happening in here (Go is statically typed), buts its the exact same thing as the fibers example, without all the manual wrapping. Any call which does IO (like line 8) blocks the currently executing goroutine (just like a fiber, a lightweight thread.) The natural question to ask is, if the goroutine gets blocked, how do other requests get processed? Its quite simple actually. The Go runtime automatically schedules any other goroutine which is ready to run (their IO call is done) on the thread on which the current goroutine was running.</p>

<p>Since goroutines are light weight (stack size is just 4 KB in Go 1.3beta1 compared to the much larger ~2 MB thread stacks), it is not unusual to have hundreds of thousands of goroutines actively running in a single process, all humming along together. The best part, since the threads have to do less context switching (the same physical thread can continue running on the processor core, just the instruction pointer keeps changing as the goroutines shuffle in and out, just as in method calls), we are able to extract a lot more efficiency from the same unit of hardware than otherwise. Otherwise IO calls, which would otherwise cause the thread to block and wait, could cripple the system and bring it down to its knees. Read <a href="http://venkateshcm.com/2014/05/How-To-Determine-Web-Applications-Thread-Poll-Size/">this</a> article for more context on this.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>A fellow ThoughtWorker asked me, &ldquo;Does performance matter when choosing a framework?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know where he was coming from, and how we shouldn&rsquo;t make decisions purely based on performance (we would all be doing assembly if that was the case.) While it is true that as a startup (or even in the case of a well established player), building the MVP and getting it to the users is paramount, you really dont want to face the situation where you suddenly have a huge influx of users (say it goes viral) and you are caught between a ROCK (scale horizontally by throwing compute units at the problem) and a HARD PLACE (have to rewrite the solution in a technology more amenable to scaling.) Both of these options are expensive, and can potentially be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Therefore, provided everything else is more or less equal, choosing the more performant one is never a bad thing.</p>

<p>With this context, I decided to compare the two solutions for their performance, given that they more or less looked the same. I decided to allow the system under test to use as many cores as they wanted, and then hit them with 100 concurrent users, each of which is going full tilk for around 20 seconds (used the awesome <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> tool for benchmarking.)</p>

<p>The results:</p>

<p>* The Callbacks, Fibers and Promises versions are created using Express. The Stdlib versions use the <strong>http</strong> support in the corresponding standard libraries.</p>

<p>All the numbers are in <strong>req/s</strong> as given by wrk (higher is better.) The latency details are in brackets (lower is better.) Clicking the numbers will take you to the corresponding code in the <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/fibrous">GitHub repo</a> (the <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/fibrous/blob/master/README.md">README</a> has the detailed numbers.)</p>

<p>The tests were done on an updated Ubuntu 14.04 box with a Intel i7 4770 processor, 16 GB of RAM and a SSD.</p>

<p>As you can see, the <strong>fibers</strong> method of doing async IO in <strong>node.js</strong> comes with a perceivable loss in throughput compared to the pure <strong>callbacks</strong> based approach, but looks relatively better than the <strong>promises</strong> version for this micro-benchmark.</p>

<p>At the same time, the default way of doing IO in Golang does very well for itself. More than <strong>134,000 req/s</strong> with a <strong>3.81 ms</strong> 99th percentile latency. All this without having to go through crazy callbacks/promises hoops. How cool is that?</p>

<h2>How the tests were run?</h2>

<h3>Software versions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Go 1.3beta1</li>
<li>node.js 0.10.28</li>
<li>wrk 3.1.0</li>
</ul>


<h3>Command used to run</h3>

<p>A more detailed description is available in the <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/fibrous">README</a> but I will explain a simple version here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start the program (by say running ./start_martini.sh)</li>
<li>Run the benchmark (by running ./bench.sh)</li>
<li>Record the result</li>
<li>Rince and repeat 3 times and take the best run</li>
</ul>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>All cores on the Intel i7 4770 were set to the performance governor</li>
<li>Redis was not tweaked</li>
<li>ulimit was not raised</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is part 1 in a multipart series looking at how async IO (and programming in general) is done in various languages/platforms. We will be going indepth into one language/platform with the every new article in the series. Future parts will look at Scala, Clojure, Java, C#, Python and Ruby based frameworks and try and present a holistic view of the async world.</p>

<p>But one thing is very clear, async IO is here to stay. Not embrassing it would be foolhardy given the need to stay lean. Hope these articles help you understand gravity of the decision.</p>

<p>While some might argue that what we did in Golang was not really async, as the call was blocking in nature. But the net result achieved, and the reason why Go is still able to provide an awesome throughput despite blocking IO calls, is because the Go runtime essentially does the heavy lifting for you. When one goroutine is busy waiting for the results of a IO call to come back, other goroutines can take their place and not waste CPU cycles. The fact that this mechanism allows us to get away with fewer threads that would be required otherwise, is the icing on top.</p>

    <link href="http://kidoman.io/programming/god-save-the-js.html"/>
    <updated>2014-05-10T03:15:15+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://kidoman.io/programming/god-save-the-js</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Golang has has this feature right from the start. Very innocuously named <code>gofmt</code> this tool (distributed as part of the Go compiler toolchain) ensures that all Go code have a common look and feel to it. It does that by enforcing a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the imports are all sorted alphabetically</li>
<li>Removes all unneeded semicolon from the code</li>
<li>Aligns <code>const</code>, <code>var</code> and <code>struct</code> constructs so that the variable names all line up nicely</li>
</ul>


<p>Since <code>gofmt</code> is integrated into most text editors used to work on Golang, using the tool becomes ubiquitous. Essentially, it can take Go code which looks like this:</p>

<p>```go
package main</p>

<p>import &ldquo;github.com/go-martini/martini&rdquo;</p>

<p>import &ldquo;log&rdquo;</p>

<p>func main() {
  m := martini.Classic()
  log.Print(&ldquo;Starting&hellip;&rdquo;);</p>

<pre><code>m.Run()
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
and make it this:</p>

<p>```go
package main</p>

<p>import (</p>

<pre><code>"log"

"github.com/go-martini/martini"
</code></pre>

<p>)</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<pre><code>m := martini.Classic()
log.Print("Starting...")
m.Run()
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Unless otherwise instructed, it also does all indentation using real tabs. Before you turn away in disgust, let me tell you this. Its actually quite amazing how TABS, when done right, can actually be a benefit. Since all Go code gets run through <code>gofmt</code> anyways, all Go code end up using real TABs. And that allows for people to have their own indentation widths without effecting the actual sourde code. Want more spacing, sure go ahead and ask your favorite editor to represent the TAB as 8 spaces, DONE! Coming from Ruby land, 2 spaces for a TAB it is then. Might sound too good to be true, but it just works.</p>

<h2>Enter JavaScript</h2>

<p>This Github repo showed up in HackerNews front page today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rdio/jsfmt">https://github.com/rdio/jsfmt</a></p>

<p>Looks like an attempt to bring the same <code>gofmt</code> magic over to the JavaScript land. And I am excited about the sanity that will ensue if this becomes popular among JavaScript programmers. One true/universal way for all JavaScript code formatting. Having suffered <code>IntelliJ</code>&rsquo;s shoddy JavaScript default formatting enough, this feels like the light at the end of a tunnel.</p>

<p>So <code>go spreadTheWord()</code></p>

    <updated>2014-05-06T06:55:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://kidoman.io/life/embd-behind-scenes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the impatient, TheBot was an experiment to kickstart a hardware engineering culture at <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong>. We choose the Raspberry Pi (RPi) as the prototyping platform and Golang as the language in which to create the firmware. We felt the need for a solid hardware abstraction layer (HAL) which would allow us to not only target the RPi, but soon expand to other platforms as well. We also wanted to make it dead easy to talk to a variety of sensors. Since there were no such existing frameworks for <a href="http://golang.org/">Golang</a>, we ended up writing our own, and we called it <a href="https://embd.kidoman.io/">EMBD</a> (<a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd">Github</a>).</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>EMBD</strong> enables you to get started on your project quickly by providing build in support for the various <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd#platforms-supported">platforms</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd#protocols-supported">protocols</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd#sensors-supported">sensors</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd#controllers">controllers</a>. It also allows your prototyping code to survive through to production because of the built in hardware abstraction layer and Golang&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd/wiki/Why-Go">versatility</a>. Thus significantly shortening the <strong>time to market</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<h2>A little history</h2>

<p>A 20 year old company, <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong> has been primarily into software. We have made our mark in the ability to create high quality custom enterprise grade software over the years. Data analytics is a key focus areas, but there are others with deeper pockets already investing. Mobile development is also a conquered field. So when our chairman, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Roy_Singham">Roy</a>, asked ThoughtWorkers to preempt the next big thing, we naturally started looking at the Internet of Things (<strong>IoT</strong>) as one of the avenues for innovation. Approaching it from a purely hardware perspective would have meant a lot of playing catch up, as we would need to seed a lot of talent in spaces before we could catch up:</p>

<ul>
<li>material science</li>
<li>industrial design</li>
<li>manufacturing, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>We wanted to get started quickly, leveraging on abilities we have honed over the last two decades. And one of the low hanging fruits to explore was the software side of internet connected devices, firmware for the rovers and quadcopters, the user experiences of these <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">new contraptions</a>.</p>

<h2>Enter, TheBot</h2>

<p>We deliberately choose to build something simple &ndash; to push the odds in our favor. However, the simplicity proved to be a boon as it allowed us a lot of scope for innovation in the software side of things. We also wanted to take this opportunity to study. To glean experiences from. From many angles, this is just scratching the surface of what is to come, but you have got to start somewhere. Think of it as bulb # 1.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/iMXjkZ4B3EM "></iframe></div></p>

<p>(We first showcased this to public on Jan 10, 2014 and dedicated the effort to Aaron, a good soul and a ThoughtWorker, who passed away on Jan 11, 2013.)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/thebot-small.jpg" title="TheBot" ></p>

<p>It was a lot of work. A lot of things you took for granted suddenly needed to be taken care of in code and in hardware. The fact that the code now had to actually &ldquo;run&rdquo; on the hardware brought in additional challenges as well. Concurrency is the name of the game. Most of the events which you needed to handle and react to (ex: a obstacle suddenly apprearing infront of the car, while the car is turning on its own) would come concurrently, in no particular guarenteed order. The firmware had to be both efficient and easy to reason about.</p>

<h2>Golang to the rescue</h2>

<blockquote><p>Created by a team at Google in 2007, Golang aimed at making software development pleasurable again. Software that built quickly, ran well on multi-core hardware in networked environments.</p></blockquote>

<p>(see the official <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project">FAQs</a> for a more complete picture)</p>

<p>Golang has excellent support for concurrency in the core language. The RaspberryPi is single threaded and we needed the car to handle multiple real world interactions at the same time. Using threads would have forced us to use mutexes, etc, for synchronization. The ‘goroutines+channels’ architecture in Golang helped us focus on the “actual” interactions. (Goroutines are light weight threads which are executed via the Go runtime on real threads via a M:N mapping. Channels are a typed mechanism for passing messages between goroutines). The resulting code is much easier to read, reason with and understand.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Simply running the binary was always enough. This helped tremendously in shortening our development/build/deploy cycles and made the process even more gratifying.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Golang is a statically typed, garbage collected and compiled programming language. However, in use, it feels like a FAST (slightly) verbose scripting language which has support for systems programming and duck typing. Since the cross compiled binary was entirely self contained, no runtime was needed. Simply running the binary was enough, which helped tremendously in shortening our development, build and deploy cycles and made the process even more gratifying.</p>

<p>(a recent article by <a href="https://www.spacemonkey.com/blog/posts/go-space-monkey">SpaceMonkey</a> details their story of switching from Python to Golang for the firmward of their embedded storage device. Its a must read to get a better idea of what Golang has to offer in this space.)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>These and various other reasons led us to create <a href="http://embd.kidoman.io/">EMBD</a> and release it to the world.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Earlier, this article was part of the <a href="/framework/embd.html">Introducing EMBD</a> piece. However, based on feedback, I decided to split them so that they the original article focused solely on the new framework and did not pull focus to other tertiary things.</p>

    <link href="http://kidoman.io/framework/embd.html"/>
    <updated>2014-04-24T06:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://kidoman.io/framework/embd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd">EMBD</a></strong> is a framework for <strong>Go</strong> which does <strong>GPIO</strong> (General Purpose I/O), talks the <strong>I²C</strong> protocol (+ many more) and provides the drivers necessary to interact with <strong>many hardware sensors</strong> (eg. gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer, etc.) It&rsquo;s non-intrusive API allows you to quickly prototype solutions (see below for example) without sacrifising production-worthiness. And the best part? The code will run on a multitude of supported hosts (like the Raspberry Pi, and the BeagleBone Black) without change!</p>

<p><a href="http://embd.kidoman.io">http://embd.kidoman.io</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd">https://github.com/kidoman/embd</a></p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/92990437 "></iframe></div></p>

<p>Although the framework started its life as <strong>go-rpi</strong>, we soon realized the potential of making it even more useful. The driver code we had written to talk to a <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd#sensors-supported">plethora of sensors</a> were not really dependent on the Raspberry Pi. They expected a I²C bus and not much else. So we immediately started thinking of ways in which we could allow people to leverage all that code in other platforms which Golang ran on (which turned out to be <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd#platforms-supported">quite a few</a>.)</p>

<h2>API Design</h2>

<p>We spent a bunch of time fine tuning the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the API. We have aimed to provide both <strong>real world usability</strong> (we did not want a toy feel to the API) and the ability to be be used for quick/rapid hardware prototyping.</p>

<p>For example, it leans towards rapid prototyping when needed:</p>

<p>```go
func main() {
  for {</p>

<pre><code>embd.LEDToggle("LED0")
time.Sleep(250 * time.Millisecond)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>Or, gives you the control when necessary:</p>

<p>```go
func main() {
  panicIf(embd.InitLED())
  defer embd.CloseLED()</p>

<p>  led, err := embd.NewLED(&ldquo;LED0&rdquo;)
  if err != nil {</p>

<pre><code>panic(err)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  defer led.Off()</p>

<p>  // Cleanly exit if someone hits Ctrl-C
  quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
  signal.Notify(quit, os.Interrupt, os.Kill)</p>

<p>  for {</p>

<pre><code>select {
case &lt;-time.After(250 * time.Millisecond):
  panicIf(led.Toggle())
  fmt.Println("Toggled")
case &lt;-quit:
  return
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }

<p>It currently has good support for the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone Black, with support for other platforms coming in the near future. This should almost guarentee that the particular combination of prototyping board, sensors, etc. would most probably work OOTB with EMBD.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>EMBD</strong> is a bold attempt at creating a cross platform embedded programming library. A lot of work is needed to flesh out the sensor library and to bring in support for new hosts. The <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">ROADMAP</a> lists some of the short/long terms goals we have ahead of us, but we won&rsquo;t get too far down that list without the support of the community. So looking forward to those <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd/pulls">pull requests</a>! Also, while we have done our best, if you do come across a bug, please <a href="https://github.com/kidoman/embd/issues">let us know</a> so that we can tackle it in the best way possible. And if you need any help, we will be hanging around <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/go-embd">here</a>.</p>
