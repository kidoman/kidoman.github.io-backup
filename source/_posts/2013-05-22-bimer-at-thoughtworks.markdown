It's been almost a week since we started [BIMER](/life/2013/05/what-is-bimer/) at ThoughtWorks.

As expected, BIMER has evolved... we no longer just do one exercise. So far we have done:

* Situps
* Lunges
* Pushups
* Plank
* (few more we have invented on the spot and don't have a name for)

Pro Tip: It definitely helps to decide the next BIMER at the end of your current work out... saves a precious few minutes at times :)

Any ways, a few snaps
