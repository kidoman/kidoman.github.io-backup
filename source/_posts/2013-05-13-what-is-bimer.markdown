So [yesterday](/life/2013/05/sitting-at-work/), I posted about how I am going to be trying a new thing at work. Instead of hampering my cognitive ability by trying to stand and work, I wanted to do some simple core exercises every hour to keep the [BMR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) up. With [Venki](http://www.linkedin.com/in/venkateshponniah)'s help, this has actually evolved to something we have now called BIMER.

The idea is simple:

* Every hour (0 * * * *)
* 10 repetitions (to a max of 15)
* Simple exercises (eg. push up, sit up, squat, lumbar stretch, lunges, etc.)
* Finish the activity in less than 30 seconds
* Dont kick up a sweat

This will ensure that we can do it every hour and keep our [BMR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) up which goes a long way in making our lives healthier. Also, keeping it simple and easy ensures you can go back to your work after BIMER and not be left panting.
