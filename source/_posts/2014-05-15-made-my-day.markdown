Saw this tweet today:

Thanks for that! =D</p>&mdash; Marco Monteiro (@mynameismarco) <a href="https://twitter.com/mynameismarco/statuses/466824607773626368">May 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

Made my day!

We have spent many sleepless nights tweaking [EMBD](https://github.com/kidoman/embd)'s API till it felt just right! Hope you guys have as much fun using it as we had creating it!

And while you are at it, follow my hero, <a href="https://twitter.com/mynameismarco">@mynameismarco</a> !
